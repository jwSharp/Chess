            <p>
              At the end of TechWise Course 1, we had a month-long break to unwind before our first project officially began.
              During this time, we freely explored and researched our areas of interest related to this project.
              We began by surveying areas the areas of interest of each team member.
              Once the project was selected, we became familiar with the rules and layout of chess, the PyGame and other Python libraries, and creating unique works of art.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              TechWise Project 1 officially started on July 6th, 2022. We began writing our first lines of code that day. This was the first major group coding project any of us have attempted.
              Throughout the first couple of weeks, we spent time diving more methodically into our areas of interest as it pertained to the game of chess.
              Work progressed quickly. Everyone was eager to contribute what they had learned from the first course, college lectures, and their personal research.
              In no time, we found ourselves with a board and game pieces. Though we found quick success in using code that worked, our issues began to pile up.

            <h2>Our Largest Hurdle</h2>
            <p>
              Much of our initial working code followed principles of functional programming. While alright way to write, it was difficult to expand.
              Our shift from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a> to 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oritented</a> programming was long and tedious at this stage.
              When most things in our code are represented as objects, adding additional features would be that much easier.
              Also during this time, we included a data structure, the stack, to implement changing from scene to scene (menu to menu).
              This shift required a lot of communication. We used <a alt="Link to request for information form." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">CRC cards</a>
              and other project management tools to keep the team on the same page.

            <h2>Full Speed Ahead</h2>
            <p>
              Since we spent so much time building a sustainable framework for our code, our next changes were a breeze.
              With a few tweaks, additional menus and the ability to check and checkmate the opponent came quickly. We succeeded in reaching our minimum viable product (MVP) on August 10th.
              At this time, cleaning up code and stretch goals were tackled. Hosting of a dynamic website, implementing a MiniMax algorithm with optimizations, and aestetic changes were addressed.
              Though we did not have enough time to finish all of these tasks, our team made a solid dent in each.

            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <p>
              As the first to present of all of the teams, our nerves were hight. On top of that, companies including Google and Amazon would be attending that night.
              Practice, practice, practice. With diligence we created a unique presentation that seamless combined our website, demo, and powerpoint.
              Due to FERPA, our presentation is protected and cannot be made public. If you are a recruiter would like to view the presentaion,
              please fill out a <a href="request.html">request</a>.
              For convenience, we include below a pre-recorded demo that can viewed below.
