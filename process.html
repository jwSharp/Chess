        <h2> Pre - Work </h2>
        <p> At the end of TechWise Course 1, we had a month of vacation to unwind before this project officially began to take shape. 
          During that time, we freely explored and researched our areas of interest related to this project, including the rules and layout of chess, 
          PyGame and other Python libraries, and drawing images with code.</p>

          <h2> July </h2>
          <p> TechWise Project 1 began on July 6th, 2022. Throughout the first couple of weeks, we spent time diving more methodically into our areas of interest. 
            Work progressed both quickly and slowly; we found quick success using code that worked, but the process of rewriting personal code to mesh with other teammatesâ€™ 
            code proved challenging.</p>

          <h2> August </h2>
          <p> From the end of July through August, our progress ramped up.  We were able to combine our code efficiently and rewrite our structures for ease of team understanding maintenance. 
            With a few tweaks, additional menus, and the ability to check and checkmate the opponent, we succeeded in reaching our MVP
            (Minimum Viable Product) on August 10th.
