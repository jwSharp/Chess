# Chess
What We Aim to Accomplish:

Website-based chess focused on the ease of playing Simultaneous Exhibitions (Simuls). A CNN will allow chess masters to play Simuls with their voice. The feature proves especially helpful when playing blindfolded. No longer will mouse-slips or mistyped words interfere with the exhibition.

Humble Beginnings:

As the first project for TalentSprint's TechWise, our group of five aims to create a functional and unique rendition of the classic chess game. The project ran from July 6, 2022 to August 22, 2022. Our team presented to a panel of industry professionals from companies including Google and Microsoft. Our final product was a fully functional chess game with a "retro" feel. Integrated was a static website that hosted the executable file for our game.
