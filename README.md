# Chess
## What We Aim to Accomplish:

Website-based chess focused on the ease of playing Simultaneous Exhibitions (Simuls). A models will allow chess masters to play Simuls with their voice or keyboard. The feature proves especially helpful when playing blindfolded. No longer will mouse-slips or mistyped moves interfere with gameplay.

### Our Beginnings:
Original Authors: [Jacob Sharp][1], [Amy Ciuffoletti][2], [Ashley Butela][3], [Mehmet Özen][4], and [Nabeyou Tadessa][5].

As the first project for TalentSprint's TechWise sponsored by Google, our group of five aims to create a functional and unique rendition of the classic chess game. The project ran from July 6, 2022 to August 22, 2022. Our team presented to a panel of industry professionals from companies including Google and Microsoft. Our final product was a fully functional chess game with a "retro" feel. Integrated was a static website that advertised our executable game. (A code freeze for the final presentation was implemented on August 19, 2022. Work afterwards is on an individual basis.)

A special thank you to our project mentor [Felipe Rivera][6] and the entire instructional team at TalentSprint's TechWise.
