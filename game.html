            <p>
              Chess, or “Western Chess”, is a game of strategy that dates back to the 15th century in Southern Europe. Each player uses six types of playing pieces -
              King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn, each with specific movements and abilities - in a bid to corner the opponent’s king with no way of escape. 
              Our version of chess uses the traditional gameplay but presents the visuals with a twist: 2D-drawn pieces interact with a retro pixelated GUI (graphical user interface), 
              with modern-styled menus and buttons leading the user to a customized version of the game.
              <br><br>At present (August 2022) the user can successfully play a pvp (person vs. person) two-player game, with a choice between 9 different timer styles, in top-down view.
              Future goals include isometric view, 3D-modeled pieces, person vs. computer, different themes/colors, and support for 5 languages (Amharic, English, Japanese, Spanish, and Turkish).
